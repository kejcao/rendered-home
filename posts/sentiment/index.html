</style><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs/dist/tf.min.js"></script><p>I&#039;ve been doing a bit of machine learning lately and have been messing around with TensorFlow&#039;s Keras API. As a fun little project I used their sentiment140 dataset to train a model to classify text as either positive or negative. I trained this model with Python and wrote it in a <a href="/tfjs/twitter.ipynb">Jupyter notebook</a>. I saved the model and used TensorFlow.js to load the model onto my website, which you can play around with below.</p><div style="padding: 1.2em 0em .2em 0em">

</div><p>I have a laptop which I use to store my daily backup that runs at midnight everyday. My machine is connected to this laptop by a spare Ethernet cable. I thought it a waste not to take advantage of its spare computing power, so I used it to train and test my model. I ran <code>jupyter lab --no-browser</code> on it to create a new Jupyter Lab server, then <code>ssh -4NL 8888:localhost:8888 backup</code> on my machine to create an IPv4, shell-less SSH tunnel from my laptop&#039;s port 8888 on localhost to my machine&#039;s port 8888. I use my machine for a lot of stuff, such as web surfing and reading, so training the models on my laptop instead of my machine helps take a lot of the stress of off it, since training models is really computationally expensive.</p><p>The model works by loading the sentiment140 dataset and cleaning the texts by removing punctuation and stopwords—words that don&#039;t contribute to the sentiment of a text. It also extracts the polarity, a number indicating the sentiment of the text. The result of this cleansing is</p><pre >1 [&#039;10x&#039;, &#039;cooler&#039;]

...</pre><p>We plug these lists of numbers into the model to train on. It reaches an accuracy of about 0.7868, meaning the model is correct in its guess 78% of the time—which is not that good. But it beats the 50% that random guessing would obtain. The model gets it right for simple sentences like &quot;I love bananas,&quot; &quot;The dog is so cute,&quot; or &quot;I don&#039;t like the new art installation,&quot; but incorrectly classifies &quot;I despise bananas,&quot; &quot;I dislike bananas,&quot; or &quot;I don&#039;t hate chocolate chip cookies.&quot;</p>{% script %}
