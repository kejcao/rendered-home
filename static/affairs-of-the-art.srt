1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,640
I'm into art now. I'm drinking from the cup of creativity again. I'm back on track, hooked,
    
2
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,040
besotted with drawing. It's all I want to do. I think I'm quite good at it, you know, in
    
3
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:33,200
a russuesque sort of way. Ivers, my model, I work him to the bone. He's very tolerant,
    
4
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,120
though. Last week when I asked him to be a nude, descending a stack, as he said.
    
5
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,480
Who we referencing, bear? Duchamp or Boccioni?
    
6
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,120
Art. I'm obsessed. I think I'm turning into my sister Beverly. She never liked drawing or
    
7
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:55,920
playing with dolls like me. She liked insects, woodlice and beetles. She kept them all in a big
    
8
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:03,840
fishbowl. She'd wait until they pegged out and she'd put them in coffins she'd made out of little
    
9
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:17,520
raisin boxes. Then she'd bury them in the garden. After a while she'd dig them up to see what had
    
10
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:28,960
happened to them. She was really obsessed. Melvin lived next door and one day Bev borrowed
    
11
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,680
his favorite train set so that her pet mouse, Peter, could ride in it. She'd bride him with
    
12
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:41,360
the promise of sexual favor. Bev forced the mouse to drive the train, but she soon got bored with
    
13
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,200
so she put things on the rails to cause derailments. Catastrophes, she called them.
    
14
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,680
She got more and more ruthless.
    
15
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,920
Finally she tried to blow up the level crossing with a firework.
    
16
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,960
She hoped to bump up the mouse with the carpet caught fire and the mouse turned brown.
    
17
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,720
But survived. Well, later he did die of trauma.
    
18
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,280
She gave the mouse the works, a state funeral into the garden.
    
19
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,240
She played Ravel's Pavan for a dead Infanta on Dad's Dunset record player.
    
20
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,720
She made us all wear black.
    
21
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:51,520
I found these the other day. My first drawings. Oh, I used to draw all the time. I just couldn't
    
22
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,800
stop. The walls of my bedroom were completely covered with my drawings. I don't know, it was
    
23
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:03,120
it was like a drug. I used to get into trouble at school for drawing all the time instead of doing
    
24
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:11,840
proper work. Once I got caught drawing our teacher Miss Maps in the nude. She knew it was her.
    
25
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,840
She recognized the hairs poking through the holes in her stockings. She just went quiet like a mouse.
    
26
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:27,440
Oh yeah, Miss Maps. Drawing's all I ever think about now. I draw all the time,
    
27
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,120
but I still make things for people too. But that last jumper I needed to read,
    
28
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:37,760
this little girl. Well, it's lovely barrel. It's really artistic. Only I never saw actually
    
29
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:45,040
wearing it. All I ever wanted to do was to go to art school, be creative, have a career. But
    
30
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:53,280
then I got pregnant with Colin. Yeah, Colin, another obsessive in the family. One day when
    
31
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,640
he was young, he brought home this pigeon. It couldn't fly. It had a broken wing. He called it
    
32
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:07,680
Percy. Oh, Colin adored Percy. They were inseparable. He did everything for him. It
    
33
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,200
was a love affair. He even hoisted him up on the clothesline so he could relate to other birds.
    
34
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,280
He built Percy a state-of-the-art pigeon coop. It had everything. Mezzanine floors,
    
35
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,240
centered heating run by a steam engine. It was a palace in the garden.
    
36
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:35,280
In the house we had nothing. No bathroom and nothing. Colin worshiped Percy. It ended in
    
37
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:50,560
tragedy though. He saw the culprit. Colin vowed revenge. The crossbow he made was precision built.
    
38
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:57,520
The arrows had Percy's feathers in them. He practiced firing at a particular piece of
    
39
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:08,400
wall and waiting. Had waited. Colin shot the cat. It landed in a neighbor's garden.
    
40
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:15,280
She was a cat fanatic. She called the police. They called it a crime of passion. Colin got off
    
41
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,440
with a caution. He's still totally obsessed with precise technical detail. You know,
    
42
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,440
things like railway signaling system. Same room as his parent when the line is already occupied.
    
43
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:36,080
It's Yamaha organ. And screw threads. 12 TPI. Flank angles for metric UNC and UNF screw threads
    
44
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:42,720
are 30 degrees. A total thread angle of 60 degrees. And he taught himself to speak Dutch.
    
45
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,160
I can't believe he's 38 and still lives at home with us.
    
46
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:59,040
Girlfriend like a normal bloke. Yeah obsession. The whole family's obsessed to something. Colin,
    
47
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:05,280
Beverly, now me. Move. I blame how grandma's influence she was obsessed to with pickling.
    
48
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,840
Grant preserved everything. Pickled in big jars.
    
49
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:19,440
Cabbage, eggs, pigs, trotters, cow's tongues, lambs, cheeks. Nothing was safe from her.
    
50
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:38,880
I've loved going to Grant's house just to stare at all the jars.
    
51
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:47,600
Especially the beetroot. Sometimes she stole some. I always knew because it left crimson stains on
    
52
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,480
her hands. She wouldn't wash them for days. She cried when the stains disappeared.
    
53
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,080
When grandma died, the woman next door came in and laid her out on the table in the living room.
    
54
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,680
She put pennies on her eyes and a bucket underneath the table with holy water in it.
    
55
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:24,960
I saw Bev sneak in.
    
56
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,600
She stayed in there for hours. Just staring and fiddling with Grant's body.
    
57
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,800
She wasn't sad though.
    
58
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,720
When she came out, she said, I kicked the bucket too.
    
59
00:07:53,760 --> 00:08:00,720
Ma'am did think Bev was a bit strange though. Well we all did. She was quite weird though.
    
60
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,480
Like when we went to the seaside, she never wanted to play on the beach with me.
    
61
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,520
She always went to the cockle stall to stare at all the pickled fish. She was entranced.
    
62
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:22,720
She saved up to buy a jar of jellydeans. She never actually ate them though.
    
63
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,520
She just brought them out on special occasions to look at.
    
64
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,760
I used to find decaying food in a room hidden in drawers.
    
65
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,880
When I asked her about it, all she said was, there's bread in the British Museum that's
    
66
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,560
2000 years old. It's a fantastic bear.
    
67
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,800
She made a necklace out of old dried up carrots with rhinestones stuck in them.
    
68
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,960
She wore it to a tenth birthday party with earrings made out of dead wasps.
    
69
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,720
I drew ponies in my scrapbook but Bev had photos of mausoleums, mummies and tombs.
    
70
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,080
Vladimir.
    
71
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:11,280
She told me she had dreams of meeting Lenin in his tomb in Moscow. She idolized him.
    
72
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:25,680
Vladimir, Vladimir, where are we going today?
    
73
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:37,200
Ah Beverly, Engelmoly. Sorry, I was dreaming I was in London on Primrose Hill eating ice cream.
    
74
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,560
Can we go to come and have my favorite purushki?
    
75
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,280
Of course, Beverly. We can't go there now. Take my hand.
    
76
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,920
Of course it was all fantasy but she was obsessed with him.
    
77
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,360
She even joined the young commoner's team to get a free trip to Moscow to see his tomb.
    
78
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:08,240
But the bus only went as far as East Berlin. So Bev quit the party in disgust.
    
79
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:15,120
That's the thing about Bev. She always went for it. Fanatical.
    
80
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:29,760
This is a seminal piece. My first dynamic self-portrait. I'm asserting my identity,
    
81
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:37,040
making my physical mark. It's a new dawn for me like Bev had when she discovered Trigger.
    
82
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:47,520
Trigger gets stuffed in California. Well, that was it, wasn't it?
    
83
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,560
Suddenly a whole new world opened up before her eyes. Bev stuffed everything after that.
    
84
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,440
She had a book of instructions. She learned it off by heart.
    
85
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,520
When her dog Rudy died, she stuffed him too.
    
86
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:30,960
Then she put Rudy on the mantelpiece. Mum said, oh thank God, no more dog's doodles.
    
87
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:38,160
When Bev was 18, she met this American G.I. Hi, I'm Lester. Can I take your daughter out, sir?
    
88
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,160
Well, that was it. She married him and moved straight to California.
    
89
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:48,000
Didn't last though. Bev spent more time at the Trigger Museum. Well, Lester.
    
90
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,960
Can you believe this? That's it.
    
91
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,200
I knew it. She's bloody Trigger-oppy.
    
92
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,080
After Lester, Bev got through a string of rich husbands and got to the
    
93
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:07,920
pile of alimony. She's had three boot jobs, butt deduction, lip collagen, and six face tucks.
    
94
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,520
And she spent a fortune fixing her teeth. Don't I look fantastic?
    
95
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:18,480
Body sculpture, she calls it. She started her first business in L.A., stuffing pets for celebs.
    
96
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:26,240
Her latest gig's called Remains to be Seen, High Tech Cryogenics for Richos.
    
97
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,560
She's big time now.
    
98
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:35,120
And what have I done with my life? I'm 59, married with a grown-up geek,
    
99
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,320
still working in a factory, dreaming about what I should have done.
    
100
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,640
I could have gone to art school, been somebody, been a contender.
    
101
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:48,160
Now it's the bloody change, right? I look like shit. I've lost my looks, my figure's gone.
    
102
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,720
And to cap it all, the other night I caught Ivor watching one of those twerking videos.
    
103
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,600
And you know what he said?
    
104
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,960
Well, to be absolutely honest, I did secretly find off the internet.
    
105
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:16,400
But when I got it, well, I spent about two bloody hours with it. But whatever I did, it wouldn't fit.
    
106
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,840
Oh, fuck it. Why am I doing this shit?
    
107
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:34,080
I hate myself. To cap it all, later on, Ivor found it in the packet on the sofa.
    
108
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,720
What's this? Opened it by mistake, did you, love?
    
109
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,800
Must be for the girl next door. I'll just take it round, should I?
    
110
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,080
Oh, you didn't try it on, did you, bear? You did, didn't you?
    
111
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,840
That's it. I need to hit a bev. She's my rock.
    
112
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:54,880
Hi, hon. You okay? I don't know, Bev.
    
113
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,480
I just lost focus, you know. I got distracted.
    
114
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,120
Don't worry about it, bear. You just got to take control. It's your life.
    
115
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,800
I mean, look at me, bear. It's real tough sometimes, but I keep pushing.
    
116
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,040
Oh, sorry, hon. I got to take this.
    
117
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,240
Well, hi. Thank you for getting back to me. I hear you want to freeze your mother.
    
118
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,800
Did you like your mother? We have an economy deal.
    
119
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,680
I'm sorry, can you hold? Bear, check me out for Christ's sake.
    
120
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,040
Don't I look fabulous? I'm sculpting myself, my own body.
    
121
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,520
I'm an exhibit, right? I'm a living gallery.
    
122
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,080
My body is my art. I got to go, hon.
    
123
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,760
Just go for it. What are you waiting for?
    
124
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,800
She's right, though. I just got to go for it.
    
125
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,600
No more arse in about. Ivor!
    
126
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,160
How we doing this, bear? Walking or running?
    
127
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,960
Dynamis knife. Velocity, energy. Speed, love. I want speed.
    
128
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,400
Here we go.
    
129
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,040
Oh, dear God.
    
130
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,840
No, we missed it again, Ivor. Oh, you're obsessed, weren't you?
    
131
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:05,520
Come on, I know. It's the movement in between, the moment of change.
    
132
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,640
I've got to capture it. I'm suffering for your art.
    
133
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,600
It's hyperfuturism, love. Go for it now. Come on.
    
134
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,920
Oh, God, I need a cup of tea.
    
135
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,520
I'm talking live with Beryl Thomas,
    
136
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,280
whose latest exhibition of drawings opens here tonight.
    
137
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,560
Beryl. Oh, hello.
    
138
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,640
Can we start by talking about what informs your work?
    
139
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,640
Well, I think it was Duchamp or Cage, maybe,
    
140
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,480
who believed that one should embark on a piece
    
141
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,320
without necessarily having a conception of its eventual denouement.
    
142
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,360
It's the process involved that's crucial to the journey that you make, see?
    
143
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,600
Interesting. It's like you're pushing the female gaze here to extremes
    
144
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,840
and, in the process, not only objectifying men,
    
145
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:01,200
but actually deforming the male body in a quite deliberate, almost vicious way.
    
146
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:06,640
Oh, no, no. I completely lose sight of the male form. Sex is not involved.
    
147
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,880
I'm just looking for what supreme moment of change,
    
148
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,720
the point of dynamic abstraction, the images in between.
    
149
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,120
It's what I call hyperfuturism.
    
150
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,840
God, this vodka's good, no?
